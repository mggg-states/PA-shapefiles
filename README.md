# Pennsylvania Election Shapefile
This shapefile was processed by MGGG staff and members of the Voting Rights Data Institute. 
The Voting Rights Data Institute (VRDI) was a 2018 summer intensive sponsored by the Metric 
Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG) at Tufts and MIT, with major support from a Bose 
Research Grant at MIT and from the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts.

## Sources
The 2011 voting tabulation district (VTD) and 2010 census block shapefiles were obtained from the US Census Bureau’s [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html). Block level demographic data for the 2010 Decennial Census were retrieved using the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1). Election data was compiled at the precinct level by a private individual. 

## Processing
Demographic data were aggregated from the census block level and precincts were assigned to districts using [MGGG's proration software](https://github.com/mggg/maup). Election data were also prorated onto VTDs from the original precinct shapefile using the `maup` package.

## Projection
The shapefile uses a UTM Zone 18N projection (EPSG: 26918).

## Rating
We give this shapefile a C rating as election results were compiled by a private individual rather than by ourselves or the Secretary of State's offce. While election results were verified at the state and county levels, we acknowledge the possibility of error at the sub-county level.

## Some notes on contiguity
VTDs in this shapefile come with district assignments for several plans relevant to the 2018 State Supreme Court case. It is important to note that because most of the plans were drawn using census blocks, there are places where the legal plans cut through the units of this shapefile. VTDs were assigned to the district that contains the majority of its area. In places this creates noncontiguous districts which can cause errors when trying to use the plan as an initial partition for [GerryChain](https://github.com/mggg/GerryChain). We suggest using the function `recursive_tree_part` to create a seed plan as a starting point. If it is important to use one of the plans provided as a starting point for chain, adding edges on your dual graph between nodes (7648,7635) and (1247,1160) should fix connectivity problems for `CD_2011` and `GOV`. The `538DEM` and `538CMPCT` plans have some VTDs that look to be incorrectly assigned in the shapefiles provided on FiveThirtyEight's [Atlas of Redistricting repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/redistricting-atlas-data). We have chosen to follow their assignments, but would suggest reassigning `GEOID10` = '420033150' to district '12' to make the `538DEM` plan contiguous and reassigning '42061430' to district '09' and '4210380' and '4210370' to district '17' to make the `538CMPCT` plan contiguous.

## Addendums
2020 AND 2014 elections were added to this dataset as a new beta version shapefile in October 2021, compiled and processed by MGGG lab members. These elections were sourced from the the Pennsylvania Secertary of State Office and were joined to the pre-existing election results on 2020 vtd shapes. This file maintains the C rating due to the difficulties in the joining process. The file holds a 99.5% vote count accuracy. Due to size contraints this data is provided here as a csv that can be joined to the 2020 Pennsylvania VTD shapefiles.
